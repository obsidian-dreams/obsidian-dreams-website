# Obsidian Dreams - Factorio Mod

**Begin with Nothing. Dream of Automation.**

---

## Welcome to Obsidian Dreams

Obsidian Dreams is a **total overhaul mod** for Factorio that fundamentally reshapes the game's core experience. Forget the crash landing with advanced technology; you arrive on an alien world with **literally nothing** – unable to mine, chop, or craft in the traditional sense.

Prepare for an epic **Genesis Phase**, a deep and challenging journey focused on:

*   **Primitive Survival:** Mastering your environment through observation and interaction.
*   **Meticulous Scavenging:** Your only initial source of resources.
*   **Intricate Crafting:** Multi-stage recipes requiring specific components and workstations.
*   **Unique Progression:** Discovering fundamental concepts via the 'Insight' & Meditation system.
*   **Settlement Building:** Gradually establishing a functional primitive base.

Only after potentially **hundreds of hours** mastering these primitive stages will you earn the right to research and build towards Factorio's familiar automation – the distant, hard-won dream.

## Core Features

*   **Absolute Zero Start:** No initial inventory, tools, or harvesting abilities.
*   **Deep Primitive Era:** Extensive pre-research gameplay spanning multiple technological ages (Stone, Bronze, Basic Mechanics, etc.).
*   **Complex Crafting:** Recipes with numerous ingredients, demanding resource diversity and intermediary chains.
*   **Multi-Block Workstations:** Detailed, functional crafting stations (2x2 to 5x5) required for progression.
*   **Insight & Meditation:** Unique system replacing the early tech tree for discovering primitive concepts and recipes.
*   **Expanded Survival Needs:** Deeper mechanics for hunger, thirst, temperature, shelter, and potential injuries.
*   **Passive Skills:** Improve proficiency through practice, gaining subtle bonuses in crafting, gathering, and survival.
*   **Quality & Rarity System:** Crafted items possess distinct Quality and Rarity levels influencing their effectiveness.
*   **Layered Primitive Armor:** Equip distinct armor pieces crafted from fiber, hides, bone, shell, and eventually metal.
*   **Settlement Focus:** Build functional structures and attract implied specialists via unique "Service Stations."
*   **Environmental Importance:** Biomes drastically affect resource availability, challenges, flora, and fauna.

## Gameplay Preview: The Journey

1.  **Bare Hands:** Start by **scavenging** loose surface items (twigs, stones, fibers). Observe your surroundings, find water, avoid hazards. You cannot mine or chop trees.
2.  **First Discoveries:** **Experiment** by combining items. Discover basic cordage, the utility of sharp stones, and potentially primitive fire-starting methods.
3.  **Seeking Insight:** Locate specific natural resources to construct the **Primitive Altar**. **Meditate** to gain 'Insights' – the knowledge needed for basic tool recipes (like the first Axe & Pickaxe) and essential survival techniques.
4.  **The Long Ascent:** Utilize your first hard-earned tools. Build rudimentary workbenches, then complex multi-block workshops (Kilns, Forges). Progress through advanced stone working, early metallurgy, basic mechanics, farming, and animal husbandry. **Expand your settlement**.
5.  **The Threshold:** Gather advanced materials and potentially rare **Blueprint Fragments** to construct the **Research Workstation**.
6.  **Automation's Dawn:** Use the Research Workstation to finally begin unlocking Factorio's standard technology tree, bridging the gap from primitive mastery to industrial automation.
